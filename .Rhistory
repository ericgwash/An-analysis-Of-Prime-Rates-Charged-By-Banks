The term “prime rate” (also known as the prime lending rate or prime interest rate) refers to the interest rate that large commercial banks charge on loans and products held by their customers with the highest credit rating. Typically, the customers with high creditworthiness are large corporations that are borrowing from commercial banks in order to finance their operations with debt.Studying the prime rates is important since it acts as an economic performance indicator and it also affects other types of interest rates offered by banks.This paper aims to analyse the behaviour of the prime lending rate and examine the existence of prime rate persistence.The data used is historical average prime rates from 1956-2015 USA.
